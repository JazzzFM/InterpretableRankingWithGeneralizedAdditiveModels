## 4. Comments on the Exercise

This report was generated as part of a technical exercise to demonstrate MLOps capabilities. The data used is the German Credit Dataset, which is a well-known dataset for credit scoring tasks.

The exercise involved building a complete MLOps pipeline, including data validation, model training, interpretability analysis, and report generation. The pipeline is designed to be production-ready, with a focus on security, scalability, and maintainability.
